# PHPdate class to bypass Y2K38 bug
This class is for bypass the 32-bit PHP Y2K38 bug

Everybody know about Y2K38 (Year 2038) on 32-bit PHP, so i decide to make this.

This class will use `$_SERVER["REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT"]` that formated as float (it's definitely infinite) to represent the time right now, so there's no Y2K38 bug, but we need PHP version 5.4 or higher for this.

If you don't need today date, you can create a date from string then call `timestamp()` function, this method will not use `$_SERVER["REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT"]` at all.

### Requirement
* PHP version >= 5.4

### Usage
```php
$your_variable = new PHPdate();			// Using PHP default timezone (you can set this in 'php.ini')
$your_variable = new PHPdate($GMT);		// Set your timezone
```

> **Note:** $GMT means GMT hours in your country, your timezone. Example: Asia/Jakarta is GMT +7

### Example:
```php
$date0 = new PHPdate();					// The default is your PHP default timezone
$date1 = new PHPdate(0);				// GMT/UTC
$date2 = new PHPdate("Asia/Jakarta");	// GMT +7 [Asia/Jakarta]
$date3 = new PHPdate(-7);				// GMT -7
```
	
### Implementation
```php
$date = new PHPdate(0);									// Create Object and date_timezone_set to GMT (+0 hour)
$my_timestamp = $date->timestamp("2016-12-16");			// Create timestamp of "2016-12-16 00:00:00"
$today_date = $date->format("Y-m-d H:i:s");				// Get today date and format it to "Y-m-d H:i:s"
$my_date = $date->format("Y-m-d H:i:s", $my_timestamp);	// Create date from timestamp
```

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `Y-m-d H:i:s` | `Y/m/d H:i:s` | `Y.m.d H:i:s` |
| `d-m-Y H:i:s` | `d/m/Y H:i:s` | `d.m.Y H:i:s` |
| `Y-m-d`       | `Y/m/d`       | `Y.m.d`       |
